## Elements of a FOSS Project
### (or what you should pay special attention to)

- The community and its structure

- Files with information and guidance

- Tools
   - Issue tracker
   - Communication channels

## Community and Its Structure: The Onion Model

## The Onion Model

.left-column2[

__Center__

- Founder(s) - the person(s) who started the project; they may or may not
be involved in the leadership and decision making
- BDFL = _Benevolent Dictator For Life_
- General leadership - group of people making decisions about direction of the project
(generally based on the community feedback)


__Core Contributors__

- Most senior and experienced people in the project
- Provide guidance and mentorship to the newer community members
- Hold the _commit bit_ - they are able to approve changes made to the project

]
.right-column2[
__Non-core contributors__

- Make regular contributions
- Active in issue discussions
- Provide feedback to the newer members of the community

__New contributors__

- People interested in contributing to the project
- Still learning the structure of the project and how to interact with the
  community


__Users__

- People who use the project

]

## Important Files

- `README`

- `LICENSE` (and/or `COPYING`)

- `CONTRIBUTING`

- `CODE OF CONDUCT`

- Style Guides

- Other
  - `INSTALL` / `INSTALLATION`
  - `CHANGES` / `CHANGELOG`
  - `AUTHORS`
  - `CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT` (or alternatively `DEVELOPER CERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN`)
  -  Other documentation: tutorials, walkthroughs, manuals, governance policies,
     especially on bigger projects.

---

## Tools: Issue Tracking

__Issue Tracker__ also called __Bug Tracker__ also called __Ticketing System__

- The _place_ where the project tracks issues related to the project

- What is the issue tracker used for?
  - feature requests
  - feature suggestions
  - bugs / problems discovered with the code or documentation
  - improvement suggestions
  - support questions
  - discussions about project design
  - team discussions

- How should _you_ use the issue tracker?
--

  - The way the project community uses it!
      - Study existing issues (both open and closed), to learn how the
        community uses the issue tracker
      - If there is documentation about how to use the issue tracker, study it
      - Follow what you learned above in your own use of the issue tracker for that project

---

## Tools: Communication Channels

Communication channels fall into three different categories:
--

- __Asynchronous__ channels (parties do not need to be connected at the same time)
   - Examples: Discussion forums, mailing lists, issue trackers


--

- __Synchronous__ (parties must all be connected at the same time)
   - Examples: Conference calls, video-conferencing, live meetings, meet-ups


--

- __Partly asynchronous__ channels (provide both synchronous and asynchronous modes)
   - Examples:  Real-time Chat (IRC[1], Mattermost[2], Rocketchat[3], Slack[4], ... )


.footnote[
1 IRC is the acronym for Internet Relay Chat. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat<br>
2 https://mattermost.org/<br>
3 https://rocket.chat/<br>
4 https://slack.com/
]

## Other Tools

- Other tools depend on the project itself

- You need to make sure that you are familiar with (or are willing to
  learn / have time to learn) the tools that the project uses.
