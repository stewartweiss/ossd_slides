## Commit Basics

- To understand branches you must first understand what a commit object is.

--

- When you create a commit by running
  ```git
     $ git commit
  ```
  Git calculates a __checksum__
  of  each subdirectory and stores various objects in the Git repository.
  Git then creates a __commit object__ that represents the state of all files
  in those subdirectories and it labels the commit object with the checksum.

--

- You can see the commit objects (but not read them) if you look at the
  `.git/objects/`  subdirectories in the repository, where you will see files
  whose names are those checksums.

--

- Each time you run `git commit`, it creates a new commit object that points to
  the previous commit, forming a "parent list" of commits (each points to its
  predecessor, called its parent.)

- At any time, there is a most recent commit.


---
## Branches Explained

- Now we can answer the question, "what is a `branch` in Git?"

--
    - It is nothing more than a __moveable reference__ to a commit object.
    - Branches are names like `master`, `feature1`, and `issue32`.
    - The first time that you make a commit, Git automatically creates a default
      branch named `master` that points to that commit object.
--
    - You can see all of the branches in the `.git/refs/heads` directory in the repository.
      They are readable files and they contain the checksums of the commits that they
      point to.

--

- Every time you make a new commit, Git moves the branch forward automatically, so that it
always points to the most recent commit. This is why it is "moveable."

---
## The HEAD Pointer

- At any given time, you have what we can call a __current branch__. This is the
  branch that is currently active. It is the one whose working directory you see
  when you type a command such as `ls` in Unix/Linux.

- Git maintains a pointer named `HEAD` that points to the current branch.
  If you display the contents of the file HEAD you will see that it is a path to
  the currently active branch:
   ```bash
     $ cat .git/HEAD
     ref: refs/heads/master
   ```
- When you change to a different branch (using the `git checkout` command), Git
 just "moves" the `HEAD` pointer to point to that branch. It also does other stuff,
 but we will get to that soon.

---
## Creating Branches

- The `git branch` command creates branches. Without arguments, it
  lists all (local) branches in the repository:
   ```git
      $ git branch
      * master
   ```
  The "*" tells you which branch is currently the active branch. In this case there is
  only a `master` branch.

--

- To create a branch you give `git branch` the name of the branch that you want to
 create:
   ```git
      $ git branch feature1
   ```
  It silently creates a new branch named `feature1` that points to the commit that
  HEAD was pointing to when you issued the command.

---

More stuff will be here.

---

## Merging and Rebasing in a Nutshell

- Git `merge` and Git `rebase` both integrate changes from one branch into
another branch, but they do it in different ways.

- In a nutshell,
   - the `merge` command takes the changes from two different
branches and creates a single, new commit record (called a __merge commit__) that combines them.

 whereas

   - the `rebase` command copies an entire branch onto  the tip of
the _base_ branch, effectively incorporating all of its commits onto that base
branch.

- Thus, instead of creating a merge commit, __rebasing re-writes the project history
by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.__

---
## Merging

- Suppose you are working on a new feature in a dedicated branch named
`feature`. Suppose that  a team member updates the master branch with new commits.
This results in a forked history:


.center[
<img src="img/forked-commit-history.png" height="300" >
]

- Suppose that you want to incorporate the new commits in `master` into your
`feature` branch using `merge`.

---
## Merging

- You can merge the master branch __into the feature branch__ as follows:

    ```git
     $ git checkout feature
     $ git merge master
    ```
 This creates a new __merge commit__ in the feature branch that combines the
histories of both branches. Your project's branching structure now looks like this:

.center[
<img src="img/merge-commit-01.png" height="300" >
]

- Notice that it creates a single, new commit record, the merge commit, in `feature`.
---
## Merging

- There are many forms of the `merge` command, and unless you memorize
what each does, it is best to use the form from the preceding slide.
Remember that:

    ```git
     $ git merge branch
    ```
 merges the changes __from__ the branch given to the command __into the currently
checked out branch__, not the other way around.

- If you can remember the syntax, this command:

    ```bash
     $ git merge feature master
    ```
 is shorthand for

    ```git
     $ git checkout feature
     $ git merge master
    ```
 i.e., it merges the changes from master into feature.


---
## Merging in the Workflow

- Merging is safe because it is a non-destructive operation -
<span class="blue">existing branches are not changed in any way</span>.

 But merging creates an extraneous merge commit each time you merge.

--

- Consider a common workflow:

   - You are working on a feature branch in a
collaborative project and there are other people working as well.
They make changes and push them to an upstream repository. You pull them down
into your master branch.

--

    - Every time that you incorporate upstream changes that are now in your
master branch using  `merge`,
you add another merge commit, and your feature branch’s history will
become "polluted" with these merge commits<span class="super">1</span>.
This can make it hard for others to understand the history of the project.

.footnote[
1 There are ways to use `git log` to clean the history up a bit, but this is
does not really solve the problem.
]


---
## Rebasing

- If you remember that the word "base" is the root of the word "rebase", then
you will remember how the `rebase` command differs from the `merge` command:
it moves the _base_ of the currently checked out branch
to a different position in the repository's history.

- Suppose once again that the project's history is as illustrated below:

.center[
<img src="img/forked-commit-history.png" height="300" >
]

 and that you want to incorporate the new commits in `master` into your
`feature` branch.
---
## Rebasing
- You can use the `rebase` command instead of the `merge` command to do this.
Namely, you can rebase the `feature` branch __onto__  the `master` branch using
the following commands:

    ```git
     $ git checkout feature
     $ git rebase master
    ```
- This finds the common ancestor of the two branches, and then moves the entire
`feature` branch from where it diverged from `master` to begin on the tip of the
`master` branch, as shown:

.center[
<img src="img/rebase-onto-feature.png" height="300" >
]
---
## Rebasing

- In effect, rebasing incorporates all of the  new commits in the command's
branch argument (i.e., `master` in "`git rebase master`") into the currently
checked out branch.

- Importantly, instead of creating a new merge commit, rebasing
__re-writes the project history__ by creating new commits for each
commit in the original branch.

- The major benefit of rebasing over merging is that the project history is
cleaner:

   - it eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required by `git merge`;

   - it results in a perfectly linear project history:
     you can follow the tip of feature all the way to the beginning of the
      project without any forks, which makes it easier to navigate the project
       with commands like `git log`.
---
## How Rebasing Works

- Git's `rebase` does the following:

--

    - it finds the common ancestor of the two branches
     (the checked-out branch and the one you are rebasing onto),

--
    - it gets the diff introduced by each commit of the checked-out branch
     (these diffs are called __patches__),

--
    - it saves those diffs to temporary files,

--
    - it resets the current branch to the same commit as the branch onto which
     it is rebasing, and

--
    - applies each change in turn.

--
- There may still be conflicts in rebasing. During the rebase, Git adds each
commit onto the new base one by one, by applying its patch. If it reaches a commit with a conflict,
and it cannot resolve it, it will pause the rebase and resume it once the
conflict is manually resolved.

- When a rebase conflict occurs, Git outputs instructions for how to fix it.

---
## A Rebasing Conflict Example

- Suppose that the following sequence of commands creates and updates a repository.

   ```bash
      $ git init
      $ echo "My first file" > file1 ; git add file1
      $ git commit . -m "Added file1 to empty repository"
      $ echo "My second file" > file2 ; git add file2
      $ git commit . -m "Added file2 "
      $ git checkout -b branch1
      $ echo "My third file" >|  file3 ; git add file3
      $ git commit . -m "Updated file3"
      $ echo "New file in branch1" > file4 ; git add file4
      $ git commit . -m "Added file4 to this branch"
      $ git checkout master
      $ echo "new file in master" > file5 ; git add .
      $ git commit . -m "Added file5 to master"
      $ echo "My latest third file" >|  file3 ; git add file3
      $ git commit . -m "Updated file3"
   ```
 At this point `file3` has a different first line in   `master`
from that of the `file3` in `branch1`. This particular difference
cannot be resolved by Git's merge strategies.  The history is forked because
the `master` branch was updated with a new commit after the commit
where `branch1` was branched off of `master`.


---
## Rebasing Conflict Example

- When we run `git rebase` from `branch1`, Git cannot
complete it because it found a merge conflict when trying to apply the patch for
the commit in the current branch on top of the commit for `file3` in `master`.
The session looks like this:

   ```git
    $ git checkout branch1
    $ git rebase master
    First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Applying: updated file3
    Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
    M	file3
    Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
    Auto-merging file3
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file3
    error: Failed to merge in the changes.
    Patch failed at 0006 updated file3
    Use 'git am --show-current-patch' to see the failed patch

    Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
    "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
    You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
    To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
   ```

---
## Rebasing Issues

- It is important to know __when not to rebase__, because rebasing is
not without downsides:
   - __<span class="standout">Safety</span>__:
Re-writing project history can be potentially catastrophic when you collaborate
with others. To rebase safely, follow the __Golden Rule of Rebasing__, given below.

   - __<span class="standout">Traceability</span>__:
Rebasing loses the context provided by a merge commit — you cannot
see when upstream changes were incorporated into the feature.


#### The Golden Rule of Rebasing
The Golden Rule of Git `rebase` is to __never use it on public branches__.

---
## A Bad Rebase

- Consider  what would happen in our example if you rebased the `master` branch
onto the `feature` branch. After the rebase, it would look like this:

.center[
<img src="img/rebasing-master-branch.png" height="300" >
]

- The rebase moved all of the commits in `master` onto the tip of `feature`.
The problem is that this only happened in your repository, not your
collaborators' repositories. They are still working with the original `master`.
Since rebasing results in brand new commits, Git will think that your master
branch’s history has diverged from everybody else’s.

---
## A Bad Rebase

- Can it be fixed?

--

 The only way to synchronize the two master branches after this is to merge
them back together, resulting in an extra merge commit and two sets of commits
that contain the same changes (the original ones, and the ones from your
rebased branch).

- In the end it becomes  messy and confusing.

- Before you run `git rebase`, always ask yourself,
“Is anyone else looking at this branch?”
If the answer is yes, do not rebase.

---
## Interactive Rebasing

- Interactive rebasing lets you alter commits as they are
moved to the new branch. This is even more powerful than an automated rebase,
since it offers complete control over the branch’s commit history.
Typically, this is used to clean up a messy history before merging a feature
branch into master.

- Interactive rebasing is also used for editing the repository history,
including __squashing__ commits.

- `git rebase` allows you to literally rewrite history — automatically applying
commits in your current working branch to the passed branch head.

- Since your new commits will be replacing the old,
it is  important to not use `git rebase` on commits that have
been pushed public, or it will appear that your project history disappeared.
---
## Interactive Rebasing

- To begin an interactive
rebasing session, pass the `-i` option to `git rebase` command:
    ```git
     $ git checkout feature
     $ git rebase -i master
    ```

 This will open a text editor listing all of the commits that are about to be
moved:
    ```git
     pick 33d5b7a Message for commit #1
     pick 9480b3d Message for commit #2
     pick 5c67e61 Message for commit #3
    ```

- The listing displayed by the editor defines exactly what the branch will look
like after the rebase is performed.

- By replacing the pick command  with another
command and/or re-ordering the entries, you can make the branch’s history
look like whatever you want.

---
## Interactive Rebasing Example

- In this example, if the 2nd commit fixes a small problem in the 1st commit,
you can condense them into a single commit with the `fixup` command. Using the
text editor, replace the word `pick` with the word `fixup`:
   ```git
     pick 33d5b7a Message for commit #1
     fixup 9480b3d Message for commit #2
     pick 5c67e61 Message for commit #3
  ```
 When you save and close the file, Git will perform the rebase according to
your instructions, resulting in project history that looks like the following:

.center[
<img src="img/squashing-with-interactive-rebase.png" height="300" >
]

---
## Rebasing in the Workflow

- Assume now that this is a team project. There is an upstream repository to
which everyone has full access rights.

- Each team member is working on a separate feature branch. The workflow that is
used is
  - You work on your local feature branch for a while.
  - When you learn that other team members have updated the upstream master
branch, you pull the new commits down into your local copy of `master`.
  - You now need to integrate the changes in `master` into your feature branch.

- Previously we saw that you could do a merge to accomplish the last step.

- But as you saw before, rebasing your feature onto the updated `master` makes
your history linear and cleaner. Therefore, in the next slide we describe the
steps to use `rebase` instead.

---
## Rebasing in the Workflow

- The first step is to update your local `master` branch. Git's responses will
of course depend on what files are present in the remote. This is just an example
with a random repository:

    ```git
      $ git checkout master
      Switched to branch 'master'
      $ git fetch upstream master
      remote: Enumerating objects: 7, done.
      remote: Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
      remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
      remote: Total 6 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
      Unpacking objects: 100% (6/6), done.
      $ git merge upstream/master
      Updating dd4fbe0..17bf6db
      Fast-forward
      gh_file1 | 1 +
      gh_file2 | 1 +
      2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
      create mode 100644 gh_file1
      create mode 100644 gh_file2
    ```
---
## Rebasing in the Workflow

- The next step is simply to rebase the feature branch onto the just-updated
`master` branch. In this case there are conflicts, which must be fixed during
the rebase:

    ```git
      $ git checkout feature
      Switched to branch 'feature'
      $ git rebase master
      First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
      Applying: added feature1_1
      Applying: changed file1
      Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
      M	file1
      Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
      Auto-merging file1
      CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file1
      error: Failed to merge in the changes.
      Patch failed at 0003 changed file1
      Use 'git am --show-current-patch' to see the failed patch

      Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
      "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
      You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
      To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
    ```
- We open the `vi` editor and fix `file1` as needed, run

    ```git
      $ git add file1
      $ git rebase --continue
    ```



---

## Summary

- These are the important things to know to start rebasing your branches.

   - If you want a clean, linear history that is free of unnecessary merge commits,
use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` when integrating changes from another branch.

   - On the other hand, if you want to preserve the complete history of your
project and avoid the risk of re-writing public commits,
use `git merge`.

- Either option is perfectly valid,
but at least now you have the option of leveraging the benefits of `git rebase`.
