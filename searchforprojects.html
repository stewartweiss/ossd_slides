# A Plan for Exploring Project Anatomy

The goal is to explore projects on GitHub, GitLab, and SourceForge so that we
can know how to see project structure on each.

At the same time, how can we present a method of finding open source projects
in which we might be interested?

Use the paradigm, search for a keyword related to your interests, with
"open source" tagged on, and rummage around the results.

# My Approach

I like architecture, so I searched for open source applications related to  architecture:

 - searched for "architecture open source"

--

 - found this page:<br>
   https://www.how2shout.com/tools/free-and-open-source-software-for-architecture-or-cad.html

--

 - Clicked through link for Archimedes, an Open CAD tool, and found<br>
   https://archimedescad.github.io/Archimedes/

--

 - Is it open source? What is its license?

 - Clicked through Source and Repository link and found ...<br>
   GitHub repo: https://github.com/ArchimedesCAD/Archimedes

   Explore this repo to see what it has and does not have.

---
# What About the Other Projects? Worth Considering?

 - Curious about SweetHome 3D on that same first page so I clicked
   through its link and came to <br>
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/sweethome3d/

--

 - This one is on SourceForge. This has a different structure completely.

 - Exercise:  Try to find the docs and tools for this one.

---
# Are there Big Projects on GitLab?

- Yes, many many.

- The Epiphany browser is there:

   Wanted to see structure of the Epiphany browser's erpository on GitLab:<br>
   https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/epiphany

- So where are those files in GitLab and how is GitLab's interface and structure
  different from GitHub's?
