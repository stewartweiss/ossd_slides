__Mirror mirror on the wall, what's the most important open source project of them all?__

--

- Are you asking about economic impact? Then it's probably Linux, or maybe the Apache Web server.

--

- Are you asking about user base? In that case I'm thinking Google's Android, or Mozilla.

--

- But if you're talking about active participation, getting people's hands on the guts of the thing,
having them donate that back to the commons, and fulfilling the idea behind open source, there can
be only one answer. __Wikipedia.__

# So What is Wikipedia?

--

- It is a freely licensed encylopedia, using the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)

--

--

# Wikipedia Content

- It strives for a neutral point of view.

- Most edits are from registered users (people who created accounts).
  Sometimes people vandalize the content, but it is caught very quickly usually.
  See [https://flip.it/DlSvQA](https://flip.it/DlSvQA) for an example.

- As is true of all encyclopedias, it is not usually appropriate to use as
a citable source, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.

- It was originally in English.

- As of April 2019, there are more than 300 different language editions of Wikipedia.

- The English-language edition accounts for about 12% of all articles in all
language editions of Wikipedia.

# Wikipedia Principles
### The Five Pillars
( See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars)

These are the fundamental principles that underly Wikipedia<span  class="super">1</span>:

|     |                   |
|-----|:------------------|
|<img src="img/47px-Encyclopedia_icon.svg.png" width="50" >      | Wikipedia is an encyclopedia |
|<img src="img/47px-Scale_icon_green.svg.png" width="50" >       | Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view |
|<img src="img/47px-Jigsaw_piece_yellow_01.svg.png" width="50" > | Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute |
|<img src="img/47px-Smiley_icon_orange.svg.png" width="50" >     | Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility|
|<img src="img/47px-Light_bulb_icon_red.svg.png" width="50" >    | Wikipedia has no firm rules |

The English Wikipedia does not have a single, definitive statement of the
community's values and principles. Editors have written summaries of these
values and principles and essays about what they think is important, which can be found
at [Wikipedia Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Principles).
