# Professional Developers
## Why do we code?
### (according to StackOverflow)

The following "facts" are based on<br>
[Insights from Stack Overflow’s 2018 survey of 100,000 developers](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey-faac8d3eb357) by Quincy Larson.
<br>
(article is based on StackOverflow's annual developer survey).

# Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software

- [Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software](http://www.timreview.ca/article/399) by Chamindra de Silva, Dec. 2010
defines humanitarian free and open source software as follows:

   - __Humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS)__ represents the application of free
and open source software (FOSS) to the coordination problems faced in the
humanitarian and disaster-response domains.

  But it is also software related to:

  - Human rights
  - Advocacy
  - Development Cooperation
  - Assistive/Accessible Technologies

- A more general definition is given in [1]:
    - HFOSS is software that serves society in some direct way.

# Beginnings

- The tsunami that hit Asia in 2004 was a wake-up call to computer professionals
who wanted to build software to help victims of natural disasters.

- One of the first mentions of HFOSS was in 2007.
The Humanitarian FOSS Project was a collaborative, community-building project
that was started by a group of computing faculty and open source proponents
at Trinity College, Wesleyan University, and Connecticut College. [more](http://www.hfoss.org/)

 Although not as active now, the organization still supports HFOSS projects.

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics provides visualization, analysis and
download of large-scale cancer genomics data sets.

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). The public cBioPortal site is hosted
by the Center for Molecular Oncology at MSK. The cBioPortal software is
now available under an open source license via GitHub. The software is now
developed and maintained by a multi-institutional team, consisting of MSK,
the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto,
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Hyve in the Netherlands, and
Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.

## [Open Energy Dashboard](https://openenergydashboard.github.io/)


.right-column2[

<br><br>
This project, also known as OED, is developing a web-based application to
display energy information that is read and stored from energy meters.
While the project involves a lot of technology, it is ultimately about
sustainability and supporting those goals. The software is free and, as
an open source project, you have access to the code developed and used.
They welcome people becoming involved in the project or using this system
on their own sites. If you want to see an example of a live system it is
available at oed.beloit.edu/demo. Additional information is available at
[https://openenergydashboard.github.io/](https://openenergydashboard.github.io/).

[Dickinson’s College Farm](https://farmdata.dickinson.edu/) is a 80-acre, USDA-certified organic
farm and a living laboratory where students can gain distinctive,
hands-on learning experiences.

Web-Based Mobile Database Applications to Support Organic Farming

- __FarmData__: for entering and reporting crop production
records, including seeding, transplanting, harvest, cover
crop, compost, fertilization, irrigation, pest scouting, spray
activities, packing and distribution records and customer
invoicing.
- __AnimalData__: for keeping livestock production records, from
birth to slaughter or sale. Other data captured by the
system includes pasture moves, periodic and veterinary
care and logging of egg production.

## [LibreFoodPantry](https://librefoodpantry.org/#/)

The mission of LibreFoodPantry is to expand a community of students and faculty
across multiple institutions who believe software can be used to help society.
The objective is to support local food pantries with quality, adaptable,
free and open source software (FOSS) to help them serve their guests.
Through learning opportunities within FOSS food pantry projects,
LibreFoodPantry provides students with the perspective that computing can be used
for social good. It is a relatively new project needing contributions.

- The project is hosted on GitLab: [https://gitlab.com/LibreFoodPantry](https://gitlab.com/LibreFoodPantry).

- It is a multi-institutional effort whose partner institutions are
    - Nassau Community College
    - Western New England University
    - Drexel University
    - Worcester State University

- Sub-projects include
    - BEAR-Necessities-Market, a web app for ordering food
    - FoodKeeper-API, an API for USDA FSIS FoodKeeper data
    - librefoodpantry.org, the web front end for the organization
   and many others.

- Anyone can suggest a new project and there are no restrictions on the programming language
  used for its development.

## [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Our mission: to help people learn to code for free.
We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles,
and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public.
We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.
