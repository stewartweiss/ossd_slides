# Open Source
# is NOT a Business Model

--

## but,
## there are business models that are
## built around open source projects

--

- there is money made in the world of open source

- many people think that open source, as an idea, is antithetical to the
idea of making money
    - if this was the case, the business world would not be using and
    participating in open source projects

and the open source project itself

Examples:
- [TideLift](https://tidelift.com/about)
