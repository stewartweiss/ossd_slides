## Remote Repositories

- A __remote repository__ is technically a version of your project other than
the local repository. It can be on the same machine, or on a different machine
on your local network, or on a remote network. It is usually just called a
__remote__, for short.

- Usally, remote repositories are versions of your repository that are hosted on
the Internet or on another network to which you have access.

- You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or
read/write for you.

- Quite often, the remotes are maintained by someone else and you do not have
write access to them.

- Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and
moving data to and from them when you need to share work.

- Managing and working with remote repositories includes knowing how to
 - add remote repositories,
 - remove remotes that are no longer valid,
 - manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not,
 - moving data to and from the remotes (i.e., fetching, pulling, and pushing).

---
## Viewing the Remotes
- Git lets you give short names called __handles__ for the URLS of your remotes.

- To see which remotes you have configured, you can run the `git remote`
command. It lists the short names of each remote handle you’ve specified.

- If you cloned the repository, you should at least see `origin` which is the
default name Git gives to the server from which you cloned. The `-v` option
shows the URL associated with the remote. For example, if we cloned the repository

   `https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git`

  to the local machine we will see
   ```git
     $ git remote -v
     origin	https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git (fetch)
     origin	https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git (push)
   ```
---
## Adding a Second Remote

- To add a new remote, use `git remote add` specifying the handle name and the
URL:
   ```git
    $ git remote add remote-repo https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature.git
   ```

- We can look at out remotes again to verify that the new remote is there:
   ```git
    $ git remote -v
    origin	https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git (push)
    remote-repo	https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature.git (fetch)
    remote-repo	https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature.git (push)
    ```
---
## Remote Branches
- Remember that a branch is just a __reference__ to a commit object. Internally,
it is a file containing the SHA-1<span class="super">1</span> number of a
commit object. It is like a
pointer in a program, or a symbolic link in the Linux file system.

- __Remote references__ are references _in your remote repositories_,
including branches, tags, and other things. They are __not__ local.
You can get a full list of remote references explicitly with
.left-column2[
   `git ls-remote [remote]`
]
.right-column2[
   `git remote show [remote]`<br> for even more information.
]
.below-column2[
]

---
## Remote-Tracking Branches

- __Remote-tracking branches__ are __local__ branches. They are references to
the state of remote branches. They are like constant pointers - you cannot move
them. Only  Git can move them for you, which it does  whenever you do any network communication,
to make sure they accurately represent the state of the remote repository.

- The purpose of a remote-tracking branch is to remember the last known
position of the branch in the remote repository.

- Remote-tracking branches take the form &lt; remote &gt;/&lt; branch &gt;.
For example the remote-tracking branch for the `master` on `origin` is
`origin/master`.

.footnote[
1 - An SHA-1 number is a 160-bit hash value, the output of a cryptographic hash
function.
]
---
## Remote Branch Terminology
- Unfortunately, the terminology is a bit confusing and ambiguous.

- The branch on a remote is called a "remote branch", but people often use
"remote branch" as a short-hand for "remote-tracking branch".

- Even worse,
there are local branches that can __track__ remote branches, and these are not
called remote-tracking branches.  For example, when you clone a repository
and Git sets up `origin/master` as a remote-tracking branch, it also sets
your local `master` branch to __track__ `origin/master`. (Egads!)

- In these notes, when we want to refer to the branch that is __in__ the remote
repository, we will call it the __remote's branch__, not the __remote branch__.
We will use "remote branch" as a short-hand for "remote-tracking branch."

---
## Example

- Assume there is Git server on the network at `git.ourcompany.com`.
You clone from this, and Git’s `clone` command automatically names the remote
`origin` for you, pulls down all its data, creates a reference to where its
`master` branch is, and names it `origin/master` locally.

- Git also gives you your own local `master` branch starting at the
same commit as the `origin/master` branch. The picture is

---
## How Git Organizes and Stores  Branches

-  Git keeps remote and local branch commits separate from each other through
the use of __branch refs__. The refs for local branches are stored in
`.git/refs/heads/`.

- In the repository directory, if you enter
   ```bash
    $ ls .git/refs/heads
   ```
you will see the branches as if you typed
   ```bash
    $ git branch
   ```
- As with local branches, Git also has refs for remote branches - remote branch
refs are stored as files in the `.git/refs/remotes/` directory.

---
## Working With Remotes

- To list the remote branches,  use the `-r` flag to `git branch`.
If we do this in the repository that we cloned earlier, `devel.git`, we see
   ```git
    $ git branch -r
       origin/feature1
       origin/master
   ```

- Although we added the remote `remote-repo` we do not see its remote branches
because we have not fetched that data yet. When we do, this command will display
more information.

---
## About Cloned Repositories

- You have used the `git clone` command to make an exact copy of a remote repository
many times by now, and you probably think you understand it completely. Perhaps
you do. But maybe not.

- The documentation states that `git clone`
   "_copies a repository into a newly
created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the
cloned repository (visible using `git branch --remotes`), and **creates and
checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s
currently active branch**._" (emphasis mine)

- This means that when you clone a repository that has multiple branches,
after you clone it and `cd` into its working directory, if you enter the
`git branch` command all you will see is the `master` branch, nothing else.
Try it!

- For example, within the `devel` repository that  I cloned earlier, I view
the remote branches and the local branches and this is what I see:
   ```git
     $ git branch -r
       origin/feature1
       origin/master
     $ git branch
       * master
   ```
---
## About Cloned Repositories (2)

- Git does not actually create a branch locally until you actually need it.
To prove this we now checkout the `feature1` branch even though it is not a
local branch yet:
   ```git
     $ git checkout feature1
      Branch 'feature1' set up to track remote branch 'feature1' from 'origin'.
      Switched to a new branch 'feature1'
     $ git branch
     * feature1
       master
   ```
---
## About Fetching and Pulling
- The `git fetch` command downloads commits, files, and refs from a
remote repository into your local repository.
It lets you see the history of the upstream repository,
but it does not force you to actually merge the changes into your local repository.

- Git isolates the fetched content  separately from existing local content.
Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the `git checkout` command.

- In this sense, fetching is a __safe__ way to review commits before
integrating them into your local repository.

- In contrast, `git pull` is more aggressive;
it  downloads the remote content for the currently checked out local branch
and immediately executes `git merge` to create a merge commit for the new
remote content.


---
## Using the `fetch` Command
- The `git fetch` command works as follows.
- To fetch the data from a remote repository named `repo`, use
   ```bash
    $ git fetch repo
   ```
 By default,
   ```bash
    $ git fetch
   ```
 will fetch from `origin` alone. To fetch all remotes, use the `--all` flag.

- If you are cautious, use
   ```bash
    $ git fetch --dry-run --verbose
   ```
 to see what Git would do without actually doing it.

- To fetch specific branches from the remote, list them after the remote:
   ```bash
    $ git fetch remote-repo  master feature2
   ```
---
## Creating a Local Branch for an Upstream Feature Branch
- The next few slides demonstrate how to fetch a remote branch and update
our local working state so that it contains the remote contents.

- In this example, we assume that there is a central, remote repository  that
we cloned from using the git `clone` command, namely
```bash
  https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git
```
 We also assume that the remote repository whose handle is `remote-repo`
contains a feature branch named `feature2` that  we want to  configure, fetch,
and examine.

---
## Fetching a Remote Branch:
### 1. Inspect the Remote First
- We will fetch a remote branch and update our local working state to the
remote contents, using  the example from previous slides.
The local repository was cloned from the `devel.git` repo on GitHub, and a remote named
`remote-repo` was added that maps to

 `https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature.git`


- First we inspect the `remote-repo` repository with  `git remote show`:
   ```git
     $ git remote show remote-repo
     * remote remote-repo
       Fetch URL: https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature.git
       Push  URL: https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature.git
       HEAD branch: master
       Remote branches:
         exploratory new (next fetch will store in remotes/remote-repo)
         feature2    new (next fetch will store in remotes/remote-repo)
         master      new (next fetch will store in remotes/remote-repo)
       Local ref configured for 'git push':
         master pushes to master (local out of date)
   ```
 Notice that `master` is configured to push to this repo's `master` branch.
If we were to fetch this remote's data, `master` would track its `master`
branch.

---
## Fetching a Remote Branch:
### 2. Inspect Origin for Comparison
- We  also inspect the `origin` remote before continuing, and notice the
difference:
   ```bash
     $ git remote show origin
     * remote origin
       Fetch URL: https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git
       Push  URL: https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel.git
       HEAD branch: master
       Remote branches:
         feature1 tracked
         master   tracked
       Local branch configured for 'git pull':
         master merges with remote master
       Local ref configured for 'git push':
         master pushes to master (up to date)
   ```
 Here it shows that the two branches in `origin` are being tracked (locally).
This is because we pulled that data down already and Git set up the local branches
to track the remote's branches.

---
## Examining  a Remote Branch:
### 3. Fetch the Selected Branch
- We fetch the `feature2` branch from `remote-repo`:
   ```git
    $ git fetch remote-repo feature2
    warning: no common commits
    remote: Enumerating objects: 27, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (27/27), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
    remote: Total 27 (delta 7), reused 17 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (27/27), done.
    From https://github.com/stewartweiss/devel-newfeature
     * branch            feature2   -> FETCH_HEAD
     * [new branch]      feature2   -> remote-repo/feature2
   ```
 Git produces a lot of output when we do this, which we ignore for now.
The important output is that Git ultimately creates a remote-tracking branch
`remote-repo/feature2` that points to the `feature2` branch from the remote.
---
## Examining  a Remote Branch:
### 4. Check Out the Branch

- Next we check out this branch:
   ```git
    $ git checkout remote-repo/feature2
    Note: checking out 'remote-repo/feature2'.

    You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
    changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
    state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

    If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
    do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

      git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

    HEAD is now at 8d427c2 Create feature2_file1
   ```
- The message about our being in a `detached HEAD` state means that we
have moved our `HEAD` pointer to a ref that is not in sequence with our
local history. This is normal and expected. We will follow Git's advice
shortly.

---
## About Detached HEAD States
- The `HEAD` pointer in Git determines your current working revision
as well as the files that Git puts into the project's working directory.

- Normally, when checking out a proper branch name, Git automatically moves the
`HEAD` pointer along for each new commit.

- In certain situations, Git will not do this, such as when you move HEAD
to a commit not pointed to by a branch. If you make changes and commit them,
these changes will not belong to any branch! This is why it warns you about
the peril of being in this state.

---
## Examining  a Remote Branch:
### 5. Create a Local Tracking Branch for the Upstream Feature Branch
- Since `HEAD` is pointing to  the `remote-repo/feature2` ref, we can create a
new local branch from that ref using the suggestion in the output:
  ```bash
    $ git checkout -b feature2 remote-repo/feature2
     Switched to a new branch 'feature2'
  ```
- This creates a new local branch named `feature2` and updates `HEAD` to point to
the latest remote content, allowing us to continue development on it from this point.

- Checking out a local branch from a remote-tracking branch automatically
creates what is called a __tracking branch__, and the branch that it tracks is
called an __upstream branch__.

---
## Examining  a Remote Branch:
### 5. About Tracking Branches

- Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a
remote branch. If you are on a tracking branch and type `git pull`, Git
automatically knows which server to fetch from and which branch to merge.

- A command equivalent to the above uses the `--track` option:
   ```bash
    git checkout --track remote-repo/feature2
   ```
---
## Examining  a Remote Branch:
### 6. Summary

- The preceding example demonstrated that if all we want to do is examine and
work on a separate feature branch from a remote repository, it is enough to
fetch the remote branch, check it out, and set up a local tracking branch for it.
Git will update the local state and there is no need to do a merge.

- This is an alternative workflow:
 ```git
   $ git checkout -b feature2
   Switched to a new branch 'feature2'
   $ git fetch remote-repo feature2
    remote: Enumerating objects: 27, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (27/27), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
    remote: Total 27 (delta 7), reused 17 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (27/27), done.
    From https://github.com/stewartweiss/git-exercise-04
     * branch            feature2   -> FETCH_HEAD
     * [new branch]      feature2   -> remote-repo/feature2
   $ git merge remote-repo/feature2
 ```
 that uses an explicit merge, but it does not set the local `feature2` branch
to track the remote.


---

## Another Workflow: Synchronizing `origin` With  `git fetch`

- The workflow that we present in the next few slides shows the typical workflow
for synchronizing the local repository with the central repository's master
branch.

- The first step is to fetch the most recent changes from the remote, which
we assume is `origin`:
 ```bash
   $ git fetch origin
    remote: Enumerating objects: 27, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (27/27), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
    remote: Total 27 (delta 7), reused 17 (delta 4), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (27/27), done.
    From https://github.com/stewartweiss/git-exercise-04
     * [new branch]      exploratory -> origin/exploratory
     * [new branch]      feature2    -> origin/feature2
     * [new branch]      master      -> origin/master
 ```
- We ignore the two feature branches and concentrate on updating our master
branch. Remember that `fetch` has not changed the state of our working directory.
---
## Another Workflow: Synchronizing `origin` With  `git fetch`

- Let us assume that our local `master` branch has a few commits already, as
the `git log` command can show us:
 ```bash
   $ git log --oneline
    002fcbb (HEAD -> master) added file2
    caee355 added file1
    063e5e2 added README.md
 ```
- Before we incorporate the upstream into our local repository, we want to
see what commits have been added to the upstream master, that are not part of our
local `master`. We can run a `git log` using `master..origin/master` as a
__range filter__:
 ```bash
   $ git log --oneline master..origin/master
    715082d (origin/master, origin/exploratory) Create ghfile2
    14d5dca Create ghfile1
    f2c9a98 Modified file3
    dea2ea4 Modified file2
    37d5642 added file3
 ```

- We see that there are several commits that we can download, with their
commit messages explaining them.
---
## Another Workflow: Synchronizing `origin` With  `git fetch`

- If we want all of the changes, we can run a `git merge`
(or even a `git rebase`):
 ```bash
   $ git merge origin/master
    Updating 002fcbb..715082d
    Fast-forward
     file2   | 2 +-
     file3   | 1 +
     ghfile1 | 1 +
     ghfile2 | 1 +
     4 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
     create mode 100644 file3
     create mode 100644 ghfile1
     create mode 100644 ghfile2
 ```
- We are done.

---
## Summary
- `git fetch` is a primary command used to download contents from a remote
repository. It is used in conjunction with `git remote`, `git branch`,
`git checkout`, and `git merge` to update a local repository to the
state of a remote.

- The `git fetch` command is a critical piece of collaborative Git work
flows. It has similar behavior to `git pull` but it can be considered a
safer method of updating the local from a remote because it gives you a chance
to review what will be done before actually doing it.
